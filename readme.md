# Wii Sports Billiards Iterator Script

## Usage:

Download latest Dolphin-Lua-Core from here: 
https://github.com/SwareJonge/Dolphin-Lua-Core/releases/tag/v3.5.1

- Create a save state of the Billiards game in the beginning of the game
- Change the lua logfile to the correct location
- Set the speed to something you want, and the iteration
- Put the script in Emulator\Sys\Scripts
- Load the script

The script is probably kinda bad if you actually know LUA, but it has a bunch of weird things going on, but it works.

It runs the game, records which balls were in, at which speed, and restarts.
